# turtlebotObstacleAvoidance
This is a coursework project where a simple walker algorithm is implmented which is like a Roomba robot vacuum cleaner. The robot moves forward until it reaches an obstacle (not colliding), and then rotate in place until the way ahead is clear, then move forward again and repeat.
